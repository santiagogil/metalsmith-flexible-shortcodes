#Metalsmith Flexible Shortcodes

Although there is a plugin called [metalsmith-shortcodes](https://github.com/ericgj/metalsmith-shortcodes) it doesn't really work the
way you expected (and how they work in WordPress, unlike stated). 

This aims to be a lot closer to the way the shortcodes work in WordPress:
`[foo param1="bar" param2="baz"]`

Internally this plugin uses [shortcode-parser](https://github.com/derdesign/shortcode-parser) to parse and render the shortcodes.


##Examples
```markdown
---
title: Test Page
template: page.hbt
---
This is a cool image:
[flickr src="https://www.flickr.com/photos/curlywurly1st/14438479793/in/explore-2014-06-14"]
```

And in your build file:

```js
shortcodes = require('metalsmith-flexible-shortcodes');

Metalsmith(__dirname)
    // ...
    .use(shortcodes({
        shortcodes: {
            'flickr': function(str, params) {
                return '<img href="' + params.src + '" />';
            }
        }
    }))
```

For more infos on how the shortcodes work check out [shortcode-parser](https://github.com/derdesign/shortcode-parser).

##Options

### `shortcodes`
An object with key value pairs, where each key represents the shortcode name, e. g. `[name]` and its value is the function that will be executed for this shortcode.

####Example
```js
{
    shortcodes: {
        'flickr': function(str, params) {
            return '<img href="' + params.src + '" />';
        }
    }
}
```
Can then be used as `[flickr]` in your files.


### `clean` 
If true, it will clean any `<p>`-Tags around the shortcodes, this is needed when you render your files with markdown in some cases.


##Notes
It is recommended you run this plugin after your markdown parser, otherwise you won't be able to use fenced code blocks. If you run into this issue also make sure to turn on the `clean` option.
